# Student-Database-Management-System
This is very old project I made just to learn how to set up connection between MySQL and Java.

The project is made using NetBeans IDE.

When we work on a Relational Database , DBMS has some commands that helps a user to interact with the database.Let me add some of those commands.

1.) DDL commands (Data Definition Language) :- These commands are used to create tables, make some changes (update) tables , delete tables etc.The commands of DDL include:-
A. Create     B.) Alter    C.) Truncate    D.) Rename      E.) Drop

2.) DML Commands (Data Manipulation Language) :- These commands are used to make some changes in the data of the tables and run some query on tables and get the desired output.
The DML Commands include :- A.) Select   B.) Insert   C.) Update   D.) Delete

3.) DCL Commands(Data Control Language) :- These commands are used to give access of database or take the authorization of database from a current user.These commands include:-
A.) Grant     B.) Revoke

4.) TCL Commands (Transaction Control Language) :- These commands are used to save changes and set transactions when process is in mid-way.These commands include:-
